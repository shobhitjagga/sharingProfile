# sharingProfile

### Part1

addrtrace.cpp is the pintool to output the machine access trace for the threaded program in addrtrace.out

### Part2

Takes as input the trace from part1 and computes the CDF for plotting. It works even if the input just contains the addresses without thread id.
fValues and dValues vector currently represent the CDF and can be used/modified appropriately.

### Part3 

Cache simulation on assignment 1 simulator with changed params and a subsequent call to part2 file.

### Part4

Takes as input the tracea from part1 and outputs the sharing profile of memory blocks.
